# Changelog

All notable changes to **qiick app UI** (`@qiick/app-theme` and the `@qiick` shadcn registry) are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
One version covers the theme package and the registry: a release tag `vX.Y.Z` pins both.
